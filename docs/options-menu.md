# Options Menu

The **Options Menu** is a simple, paginated inventory that lets you configure how your armor stand looks.

You can open it directly from the **ArmorStand Menu** by clicking the **Options**.

---

## Overview

When you open the menu, you’ll see a list of items — each one represents an option you can toggle or modify.  
Hover over an item to read its **lore**, which explains what that option does and how to use it.

If you want to change something, simply **click the item**, and it will immediately apply the change.

---

## Navigation

Since the menu is **paginated**, it supports multiple pages of options:
- Use the **Next Page** and **Previous Page** items at the bottom to navigate.

---

## Example Options

Here are some common examples you may see in the menu:

- **Arms** – Toggles the visibility of arms on the armor stand.  
- **Base Plate** – Enables or removes the stone base plate.  
- **Gravity** – Toggles whether the armor stand is affected by gravity.  
- **Small** – Shrinks or restores the armor stand’s size.
