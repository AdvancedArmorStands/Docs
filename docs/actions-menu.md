# Actions Menu

The **Actions Menu** is a paginated inventory that lets you view, edit, and manage all actions linked to an armor stand.

You can open it from the **ArmorStand Menu** by clicking **Actions**.

---

## Overview

Each armor stand can have **any number of actions**, there’s no limit other than what your server can handle.  
Actions define what happens when a specific trigger is called (for example, when a player interacts with the armor stand).

The menu shows all actions currently attached to that armor stand.  
If no actions exist yet, the menu will appear **empty by default**.

---

## Managing Actions

Each item in the menu represents one of your actions.

- **Click** an action item to **edit** it.  
- **Shift + Click** an action item to **remove** it.

Editing an action lets you change its command, trigger type, and other settings.

## Creating a New Action

At the bottom of the menu, you’ll find a **Redstone Block**.  
Clicking it will start the **action creation process**:

1. After clicking, you’ll be prompted in chat to **type the command** you want the action to run.  
2. Once entered, the command will be saved as a new action attached to the current armor stand.  
3. The new action will then appear in the menu.

## Pagination

The menu supports multiple pages if you have many actions.  
Use the **Next Page** and **Previous Page** items to navigate between them.
